# Boulder-Buddy

Hello!

MyClimb Research:

Overall, app has a clunky and unintuitive feel. The design is too busy and does not direct the user into a meaningful workflow. 

Goals:
MyClimb allows you to set basic goals in two categories, Climbing Goal and Workout Goal
  -Select # of climbs or days climbed as metric
    ** NO OTHER METRICS TRACKED! **
  -Choose to calculate attempts, choose to make recurring goal
Training Pyramid is a strange implementation, but the idea isn't bad
    ** IMPROVE UPON TRAINING PYRAMID **
